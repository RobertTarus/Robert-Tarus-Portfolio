# Data Engineering

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
|[End-to-End ETL Tracking Daily Seismic Events]() | May 2024 | Python, Microsoft Fabric, Power BI | Developed and implemented an end-to-end ETL pipeline for capturing earthquake activities around the world daily. The pipeline involved leveraging the 'requests' module in Python, pulled real-time earthquake data from the USGS API in JSON format, ensuring a continuous influx of up-to-date information. This raw data formed the foundation of our data pipeline, capturing historical record of seismic events worldwide. In the silver layer, we reshaped and renamed the raw data into columns to improve its quality and consistency, laying the groundwork for further analysis. In the gold layer, we imported the refined data into Power BI, creating a semantic model optimized for analysis and visualization. This dataset served as the gold standard for insights generation, providing actionable information on seismic activity worldwide. The Power BI report, using the gold layer data, offers real-time updates on seismic activities worldwide. Users can effortlessly explore the data and gain valuable insights into ongoing seismic trends. To ensure the report remains current, a scheduled data refresh mechanism is created that can pull and update new data daily. Additionally, users can still utilize the SQL analytics endpoint to access and retrieve the data for further analysis.|
